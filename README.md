# X-O-Game
X,O game it is famous with (Tic-Tac-Toe) 
This project forced me to conduct thorough research to avoid operational errors and this greatly enhanced my experience.
I think i can do good projects like this or better in future

## Description

Welcome to my final project for CS50x – **X-O Game**.

This project is a graphical version of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game (locally called "X-O") developed in **Python** using the **Tkinter** library. It allows the user to play against a simple computer opponent that makes random moves.

I chose this project because I was deeply interested in Python and wanted to explore its capabilities beyond the basics. I spent time learning about graphical user interfaces (GUI) and how to make interactive applications. This project helped me understand Python more deeply and gave me confidence in building complete software applications.

## Challenges

While developing this project, I faced significant challenges due to the ongoing war in **Gaza Strip, Palestine**. There were frequent power outages, unstable internet access, and periods of evacuation. These difficulties caused delays and made it very hard to study and code consistently.

Despite all of that, I was determined to complete this course and submit my final project. This game took me longer than expected, but I was committed to learning and finishing what I started. I hope this project reflects my effort and dedication under extremely hard circumstances.
